Brief History
=============

Infinity was originally written by Julien Carme on 2000.
Then the project was freezed for a couple of years, from 2001 to
2004 I guess.
In October 2003 I've found this plugin and I thought it was really
beautiful so I decided to improve it by adding MMX support and
created a project in Sourceforge.
In 2013 the project was moved into Github.
In 2016 code moved from 100% C to mix of C / C++ to match Audacious
3.6 API.
